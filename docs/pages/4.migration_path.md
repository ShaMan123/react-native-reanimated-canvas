## Custom Touch Handling

If you don't use `react-native-gesture-handler` or `react-native-reanimated` consider doing so.
These are excellent, performant libraries.
Non the less, a basic implementation of this library is exposed for such a case.
Take a look at [JSTouchHandling](./CanvasExample/App/JSTouchHandling.tsx).
You will have to set up touch handling yourself, you can use exposed hooks for common usage.

```ts
import RCanvasBase, { useCanvasPanResponder, useCanvasGestureHandler } from 'react-native-reanimated-canvas/base';
```
