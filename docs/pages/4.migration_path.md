## Custom Touch Handling

If you don't use [`react-native-gesture-handler`](https://software-mansion.github.io/react-native-gesture-handler/) or [`react-native-reanimated`](https://software-mansion.github.io/react-native-reanimated/) consider doing so.<br/>
These are excellent, performant libraries.<br/>
Non the less, a basic implementation of this library is exposed for such a case.

Take a look at [JSTouchHandling](https://github.com/ShaMan123/react-native-reanimated-canvas/blob/master/CanvasExample/App/JSTouchHandling.tsx).<br/>
You will have to set up touch handling yourself, you can use exposed hooks for common usage.

```ts
import RCanvasBase, { useCanvasPanResponder, useCanvasGestureHandler } from 'react-native-reanimated-canvas/base';

```
