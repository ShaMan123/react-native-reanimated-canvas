# React Native Reanimated Canvas

---

A canvas component designed especially for responsive drawing in `react-native`.

This repository was originally forked from `@terrylinla/react-native-sketch-canvas`, which is no longer active.
The source code has been heavily refactored to boost performance.

Some features have been added, some removed or changed, making it declarative, more light-weight and low-level, befitting `react-native-reanimated`.

Due to these major changes a lot more can be done with this library, including integration with other libraries and components such as `react-native-svg`.

**NOTICE:** `iOS` is not yet supported.


## Why not `react-native-svg`?

One word.<br/>
**RESPONSIVENESS**.<br/>
`react-native-svg` can be used with the library.


## Performance

1. Transparent path needs to be checked
1. All touches are now handled in native


## Example

Check full example app in the [CanvasExample/App](https://github.com/ShaMan123/react-native-reanimated-canvas/tree/master/CanvasExample/App) folder.
