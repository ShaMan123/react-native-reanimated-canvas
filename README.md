---

This repository was originally forked from `@terrylinla/react-native-sketch-canvas`, which is no longer active.
The source code has been heavily refactored to boost performance.

Some features have been added, some removed or changed, making it more light weight and low-level, befitting `react-native-reanimated`.

Due to these major changes a lot more can be done with this library, including integration with other libraries and components such as `react-native-svg`.

**NOTICE:** `iOS` is not yet supported.
